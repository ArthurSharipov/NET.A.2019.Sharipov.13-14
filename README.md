# Day 13 - 14
1. Develop a generalized Queue collection class that implements the basic
operations for working with the queue, and the opportunity
iteration by implementing the iterator "manually" (without using
iterator output). Test the methods of the developed class.
2. Create generalized classes for representing square, symmetric and
diagonal matrices (a symmetric matrix is ​​a square matrix,
which meets transposed to her; the diagonal matrix is
square matrix
have default values ​​for the item type). Describe in created classes
event that occurs when
to). Extend the functionality of the existing class hierarchy by adding
the ability to add two matrices of any type. To develop
tests.
3. Develop a generic collection class BinarySearchTree (binary tree
Search). Provide connectivity options
interface for implementing order relationships. Implement three ways
tree traversal: direct (preorder), transverse (inorder), reverse (postorder):
to implement use a block iterator (yield). To test
developed by the class using the following types:
● System.Int32 (use default comparison and pluggable
comparator);
● System.String (use default comparison and pluggable
comparator);
● custom class Book, for objects of which it is implemented
use default comparison and pluggable
comparator);
● user system Point, for which objects are not implemented
relations of order (use a plug-in comparator).
